## Featured Projects

### **[High-Performance File Processor](https://github.com/NTRCodes/high-performance-file-processor)**
**22x faster than Python baseline** – Production Go system processing 1,400+ files daily

Rewrote legacy Python file import system in Go, achieving massive performance improvements through concurrent processing, optimized database operations, and Kubernetes deployment.

**Impact:**
- ⚡ 22x performance improvement (109s → 5s per file)
- Processes 1,400+ files daily with 700k+ records each
- Production Kubernetes deployment with 99.9% uptime
- Diagnosed and fixed CrashLoopBackOff issues in production

**Tech:** `Go` · `Kubernetes` · `PostgreSQL` · `Docker` · `S3` · `Concurrent Processing`

### **[Member Management API](https://github.com/NTRCodes/member-management-api)** 🚧
RESTful API for member data and processing metrics

Production API serving member search functionality and collecting processing metrics from the file processing pipeline. Handles 1,000+ requests/minute with sub-100ms response times.

**Features:**
- High-performance member search with indexed queries
- Metrics collection and reporting
- JWT authentication and RBAC
- Kubernetes deployment

**Tech:** `Go/Python` · `PostgreSQL` · `REST API` · `Docker` · `Kubernetes`

### **[Meraki NetBox Sync v2](https://github.com/NTRCodes/meraki-netbox-sync-v2)** 🚧
Event-driven rewrite with webhook support

Modernizing the batch sync system with real-time webhook processing, Go microservice architecture, and Kubernetes deployment. Transforms monthly batch job into event-driven system.

**Planned:**
- Real-time webhook processing
- Kubernetes pod deployment
- Metrics and observability
- Event-driven architecture

**Tech:** `Go` · `Webhooks` · `Kubernetes` · `Event-Driven`
