# 👋 Hi, I'm Nigel Ross

I'm a backend engineer focused on infrastructure automation, data syncing, and developer tooling.  
My code turns multi-hour processes into automated workflows you can trust and observe.

---

## 🔧 What I Build

- **Go + Python CLI tools** for syncing, parsing, and generating structured data
- **CI/CD pipelines** for scheduled and event-driven jobs
- **Credential/token services** to eliminate `.env` sprawl and increase security
- **System observability tools** that turn raw logs into metrics and summaries

### 🔧 Projects
- **[meraki_netbox_sync](https://github.com/NTRCodes/meraki_netbox):** Sync Meraki network and device data into NetBox. Uses Python, GitLab CI, and scheduled jobs.
- **[sync-log-collector](https://github.com/NTRCodes/sync-log-collector):** In progress – Go-based CLI that fetches GitLab job logs, parses structured sync summaries, and outputs JSONL or SQLite for reporting.
- **[token-service](https://github.com/NTRCodes/token-service):** In progress – Go microservice to centrally manage credentials across CLI tools and internal bots.
